<h1>Simon Says</h1>
A color-matching game where the user has to click the corresponding colors on the screen and keep the pattern going.
<h1>How To Play</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Choose the desired difficulty.</li>
  <li>Click any key to start the game.</li>
  <li>Click the color shown on the screen and keep the pattern going ex: if level 1 highlighted green click green. If level 2 highlighted blue click green then blue.</li>
